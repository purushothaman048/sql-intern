# Task 6 - Subqueries and Nested Queries

## üìå Objective
The goal of this task is to practice **advanced SQL query skills** using **subqueries** and **nested queries** in different clauses such as `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `FROM`.  
This includes:
- Scalar subqueries
- Correlated subqueries
- Nested subqueries
- Derived tables
- Using `IN`, `EXISTS`, and comparison operators with subqueries

## üõ† SQL Queries

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Scalar Subquery
```sql
SELECT emp_name, salary
FROM Employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Employees);
Find employees earning more than the average salary.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Correlated Subquery
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT emp_name, department, salary
FROM Employees e
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary)
    FROM Employees
    WHERE department = e.department
);
Find employees earning above their department's average salary.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Subquery with IN
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT emp_name, department
FROM Employees
WHERE department IN (
    SELECT dept_name
    FROM Departments d
    JOIN Projects p ON d.dept_id = p.dept_id
    WHERE p.budget > 300000
);
Employees in departments with projects having budgets over 300,000.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Derived Table
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT department, MAX(salary) AS highest_salary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY department;
Highest salary in each department.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Using EXISTS
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT dept_name
FROM Departments d
WHERE EXISTS (
